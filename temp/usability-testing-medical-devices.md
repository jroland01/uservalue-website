Uservalue is a Swiss usability and user experience (UX) consulting agency located in <a href="https://www.y-parc.ch/en/" target=_blank>Y-Parc</a>, a cluster for medical technology in Western Switzerland. With expertise in usability testing based on 15+ years of experience, as well as a leadership role in <a href="http://uxqb.org/en/" target=_blank>usability certification</a> (UXQBÂ®), we can help you meet the regulatory requirements (e.g. IEC 62366, FDA) for market approval of your medical device.

<br />

## WHY IS USABILITY ENGINEERING IMPORTANT IN HEALTHCARE ? 


The impact of poor usability of medical devices on patients' safety must be closely monitored as the variety and complexity of medical devices for patient treatment and surveillance increases, and as the users tend to be less skilled (e.g. patients, family members). Poor usability leads to slower task completion and use errors, with sometimes severe consequences for patient safety. 

In contrast, usability engineering allows to build medical devices that are intuitive, easy to use and attractive, leading to a competitive advantage on the market. 

<br />

## HOW IS USABILITY PART OF MEDICAL DEVICES REGULATIONS ?
Regulators and international standard bodies have made usability testing of medical devices a de facto requirement. Failing to conduct usability tests and document usability activities as part of the risk management scheme can lead to the rejection of a device's market clearance application.

* In Europe, to obtain CE marking  manufacturers need to follow the recommendations in <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63179" target=_blank>IEC 62366</a> "Application of usability engineering to medical devices" (2007/47/CE Directive).

* In the US, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) has issued a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM259760.pdf" target=_blank>Guidance</a> "Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices" as part of their market approval process.


<br />

## WHICH USABILITY ACTIVITIES ARE REQUIRED FOR MARKET APPROVAL ?
Both IEC 62366 and the FDA's Guidance describe activities that need to be performed and thoroughly documented before market introduction :

* Preliminary analyses are required to identify use errors and hazards associated with a medical device. Manufacturers need to identify and document user profiles, use environments, use scenarios and analyze the tasks required for intended use.

* Formative usability evaluations should be performed early and throughout the design process to identify strengths, opportunities for improvement, potential use errors and confirm that the design heads into the right direction. Formative usability evaluation techniques include usability tests and expert reviews.

* Summative usability testing (validation) is the key source of evidence regarding use safety for both IEC 62366 and the FDA's Guidance for market approval. Summative usability tests are performed on production-equivalent devices, in close to real world use conditions, and need to measure use performance (e.g. failures/successes, close calls, task time, etc.), as well as provide an understanding of any use error (e.g. root cause analysis). Summative usability testing is mandatory for Class II and Class III devices.

## HOW CAN USERVALUE HELP WITH REQUIRED USABILITY ACTIVITIES ?

Uservalue has strong knowledge of the various standards (e.g. ISO 9241) and guidance documents governing the practice of usability, and especially those related to the usability of medical devices (e.g. IEC 62366, FDA's Guidance).

Uservalue can : 

* Provide methodological support with the preliminary analyses (e.g. use error analysis) by e.g. suggesting templates for task and use risk analysis, reviewing analysis documentation such as user FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), etc.

* Plan, perform, analyze and document both formative and summative evaluations, incl. test scenario preparation, recruitment of participants, rental of test facility/lab, pilot tests, execution of tests, gathering of both qualitative and quantitative data, analysis of test data, documentation of tests according to regulatory expectations 

* Provide all key documentation to be captured in the Usability Engineering File (Use Specification, User Interface Specification, User Interface Evaluation Plan, Usability test report, Use errors, etc.)
