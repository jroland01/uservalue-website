<h2 id="why-is-usability-engineering-or-human-factors-important-in-healthcare-">WHY IS USABILITY ENGINEERING (OR HUMAN FACTORS) IMPORTANT IN HEALTHCARE ?</h2>
<p>The impact of poor usability of medical devices on patients safety is becoming evermore important, as the number and complexity of medical devices for patient treatment and surveillance increases while their users tend to be less skilled (e.g. patients, their family members).</p>
<p>When not developed within a human-centered design process medical devices are oftentimes non intuitive, difficult to use and to learn. Poor usability leads to slower task completion and use errors, with sometimes severe consequences for patient safety. Furthermore, ease of use, attractivity of medical devices will help differentiate a product and lead to competitive advantage.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="how-is-usability-engineering-part-of-medical-devices-regulations-">HOW IS USABILITY ENGINEERING PART OF MEDICAL DEVICES REGULATIONS ?</h2>
<p>Regulators and international standard bodies have made usability testing of medical devices a de facto requirement. Failing to conduct usability tests as part of the risk management scheme can lead to rejection of the market clearance application because of insufficient use-safety data:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Europe, in order to obtain CE marking (Directive 2007/47/CE) manufacturers should follow the recommendations in IEC 62366 &quot;Application of usability engineering to medical devices&quot;. </li>
<li>In the US, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) has issued a Draft Guidance &quot;Applying human factors and usability engineering to optimize medical device design&quot; as part of their market approval process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers are supposed to document their usability activities according to the processes outlined in IEC 62366 and the FDA&#39;s Draft Guidance.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="which-usability-engineering-activities-are-required-for-market-approval-">WHICH USABILITY ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES ARE REQUIRED FOR MARKET APPROVAL ?</h2>
<p>Both IEC 62366 and the FDA&#39;s Draft Guidance describe activities that need to be performed and thoroughly documented. They can be summarized into three phases :</p>
<ul>
<li>Preliminary analyses are required to identify use errors and hazards associated with a medical device. Manufacturers should identify and document user profiles, use environments, use scenarios and analyze the tasks required for intended use.</li>
<li>Formative usability evaluations should be performed early and throughout the design process to identify strenghts, opportunities for improvement and confirm that the design heads into the right direction. Formative  evaluations can be run on functionally limited prototypes and include different techniques (e.g. usability tests with representative users, expert usability reviews). Formative usability tests allow to identify potential use errors and are beneficial precursers for summative usability tests. </li>
<li>Summative usability testing for user interface validation constitutes the key source of evidence regarding use safety for both IEC 62366 and the FDA&#39;s Draft Guidance for market approval. It is mandatory for for Class II and III  devices. It intends to obtain objective evidence that the final device can be used safely by intended users. It thus requires a production-equivalent device, use conditions that are close to real and implies measuring use performance (e.g. failures/successes, close calls, task time, etc.) as well as an understanding of any use error (e.g. root cause analysis). </li>
</ul>

<p>Uservalue has developed a strong methodological expertise and rigor in usability testing and contextual analysis, based on 15+ years of experience, as well as a leadership role in usability certification (UXQB Certified Training Provider and National Expert in Switzerland).</p>
<p>Located at YParc - Cluster for medical technology - Uservalue has strong knowledge of the various standards (e.g. ISO 9241) and guidance documents governing the practice of usability, and especially those related to the usability of medical devices (e.g. IEC 62366, FDA&#39;s Draft Guidance)</p>
<p>Uservalue can : </p>
<ul>
<li>Provide methodological support with the preliminary analyses (e.g. use error analysis) by e.g. suggesting templates for task and use risk analysis, reviewing analysis documentation such as user FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), etc.</li>
<li>Plan, perform, analyze and document both formative and summative evaluations, incl. test scenario preparation, recruitment of participants, rental of test facility/lab, pilot tests, execution of tests, gathering of both qualitative and quantitative data, analysis of test data, documentation of tests according to regulatory expectations </li>
<li>Provide all key documentation to be captured in the Usability Engineering File (Use Specification, User Interface Specification, User Interface Evaluation Plan, Usability test report, Use errors, etc.)</li>
